They were female warriors and hunters, known for their physical agility, strength, archery, riding skills, and the arts of combat. Their society was closed to men and they raised only their daughters, returning their sons to their fathers with whom they would only socialize briefly in order to reproduce.\n",
            "Courageous and fiercely independent, the Amazons, commanded by their queen, regularly undertook extensive military expeditions into the far corners of the world, from Scythia to Thrace, Asia Minor, and the Aegean Islands, reaching as far as Arabia and Egypt. Besides military raids, the Amazons are also associated with the foundation of temples and the establishment of numerous ancient cities like Ephesos, Cyme, Smyrna, Sinope, Myrina, Magnesia, Pygela, etc.\n",
            "The texts of the original myths envisioned the homeland of the Amazons at the periphery of the then-known world. Various claims to the exact place ranged from provinces in Asia Minor (Lycia, Caria, etc.) to the steppes around the Black Sea. However, authors most frequently referred to Pontus in northern Anatolia, on the southern shores of the Black Sea, as the independent Amazon kingdom where the Amazon queen resided at her capital Themiscyra, on the banks of the Thermodon river.\n",
            "Decades of archaeological discoveries of burial sites of female warriors, including royalty, in the Eurasian Steppes suggest that the horse cultures of the Scythian, Sarmatian, and Hittite peoples likely inspired the Amazon myth. In 2019, a grave with multiple generations of female Scythian warriors, armed and in golden headdresses, was found near Voronezh in southwestern Russia.\n",

            "Summary: Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis.\n",
            "Clients often use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more computing in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IoT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems.\n",
            "One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk (HDD)/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).\n",
            "AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a \"Pay-as-you-go\" model), hardware, operating system, software, and networking features chosen by the subscriber requiring various degrees of availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions, including nine in North America.\n",
            "Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm. All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2023 Q1, AWS has 31% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 25%, and 11% respectively, according to Synergy Research Group.\n",

EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an \"instance\", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the second for active servers – hence the term \"elastic\". EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy. In November 2010, Amazon switched its own retail website platform to EC2 and AWS.\n",

            "Dataflow is suitable for large-scale, continuous data processing jobs, and is one of the major components of Google's big data architecture on the Google Cloud Platform.\n",
            "At its core, Dataflow's architecture is designed to abstract away infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus purely on the logic of their data processing tasks. When a pipeline written using the Apache Beam SDK is submitted, Dataflow translates this high-level definition into an optimized job graph. The service then provisions and manages a fleet of Google Compute Engine workers to execute this graph in a highly parallelized and fault-tolerant manner. This serverless approach, combined with intelligent autoscaling of both the number of workers (horizontal) and the resources per worker (vertical), ensures that jobs have the precise amount of computational power needed at any given time, optimizing both performance and cost.\n",
            "The service's deep integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem makes it a powerful tool for a variety of use cases beyond simple data movement. For real-time analytics, Dataflow can ingest unbounded streams of data from Cloud Pub/Sub, perform complex transformations, and load results into BigQuery for immediate querying. In machine learning workflows, it is commonly used to preprocess and transform massive datasets stored in Cloud Storage, preparing them for training models in Vertex AI. This versatility makes it the central processing engine for modern ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, streaming analytics, and large-scale data preparation within the cloud.\n",

Companies that need a vast array of specialized services, high scalability, and a proven track record often lean towards AWS. Its pay-as-you-go model and continuous innovation are also strong draws.\\n\\n2.  **Microsoft Azure:**\\n    *   **Reason for choosing:** Azure is particularly strong for enterprises, especially those already heavily invested in Microsoft technologies (like Windows Server, .NET, SQL Server, Active Directory, and Office 365). It offers excellent hybrid cloud capabilities, allowing seamless integration between on-premises data centers and the cloud. Organizations looking for strong enterprise support, compliance offerings, and a familiar Microsoft ecosystem often find Azure to be the best fit.\\n\\n3.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**\\n    *   **Reason for choosing:** GCP is known for its strengths in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, leveraging the same infrastructure that powers Google\\'s own services like Search and YouTube. It\\'s often favored by companies focused on big data, AI/ML workloads, and those that appreciate its strong containerization support (Kubernetes originated at Google) and open-source friendly approach. Its competitive pricing for certain services and strong global network infrastructure are also attractive.\\n\\nIn summary, the \"best\" provider is the one that most effectively meets a company\\'s unique requirements, whether that\\'s leveraging existing Microsoft investments (Azure), needing the widest range of services and market leadership (AWS), or focusing on cutting-edge data and AI capabilities (GCP).'}"
